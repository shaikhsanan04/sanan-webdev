                I specialize in building responsive web applications using React, developing
                custom WordPress solutions, and creating stunning websites on platforms like Wix.
                My approach combines technical excellence with creative problem-solving.

                From interactive web applications to sleek business websites, I enjoy crafting
                solutions that not only look great but also provide exceptional user experiences.
